  storyText: "Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You
    see a crate with all manner of pipes, wires and cogs scattered within it. Mostly
    trash.\r\nYou could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with one of the
    pipes. Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some kind of leverage,
    maybe a mini pulley system with those wires and the cogs.\r\nHow to proceed?\r\n1.
    No time to waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.\r\n2. Take the time to build a
    leverage-gadget."
