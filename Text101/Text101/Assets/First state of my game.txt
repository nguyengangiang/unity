Fester. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.
At least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical

Could try punching my way through. or sneaking the long qay to the emergency exit

What should I do?
A: Take them head on - rush the 10 guards
B: Sneak my way to the emergency exit
